# DigiSquares web application overview

The low-code premise is simple you just need to get someone that understands your business to create the app you need in the low-code environment

<hr/>

On a low-code platform, IT and business teams work together to build high quality applications and accelerate time to market

Build enterprise grade applications that enable your customers, and partners, to better communicate and perform business transactions. Apps that promote personalized customer engagements help to improve satisfaction, retention, and revenue.

## **Get started**
## Instant development and deployment

  Any good low-code platform comes with standard components like prebuilt templates for form and report creation, and ready to use code snippets. These out of the box templates allow IT teams to develop and deploy applications faster, and with fewer errors. It also eliminate the need for creating frameworks, linking databases, and other tasks that are typically included in traditional development to see how their application looks.

## Simplified pre-built integrations

Low-code platforms allow for easy coupling with external and existing systems and new technologies, with a wide array of out of the box APIs and other smart integration tools. tasks required in application development Businesses can streamline, automate, and harmonize manual internal processes so that developers arenâ€™t overburdened and can focus on higher value tasks. Minimizing overwhelming coding needs gives IT relief from the pressure of their often times unconquerable app backlog.

## Eliminate backlogs and reduce shadow IT

Successful projects are improved by indirect audience feedback, such as how they interact with the apps. Whether gathering feedback during usability testing or after the app goes live, successful project teams keep a close analytical eye on their audience. Conduct usability testing during development, and use analytics after launch to identify popular features and functions. Continually improve the application by incorporating user feedback and analytical insights.

## Reduce reliance on legacy apps

Outdated legacy applications, although vital to business processes, drain efficiency, and keep your IT resources in a constant state of updates and fixes. This means you spend more time on maintenance than innovation. Revive your business ecosystem using low code platforms, with modern frameworks that can build consumer grade applications.
