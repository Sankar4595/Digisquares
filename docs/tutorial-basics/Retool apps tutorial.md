# Retool apps tutorial: Introduction

An interactive course that teaches you to build your first app.

<hr/>

This tutorial is an interactive course to learn about Retool. Each lesson covers the core concepts of Retool and guides you through the steps to build a simple user management app.

## Prerequisites

Familiarity with common technologies like APIs, SQL, and JavaScript is expected to complete this course. If you need to learn more about these technologies, we recommend using online learning resources, such as:

- <a class='link-tutorial' href='#'>Freecodecamp: How to use REST APIs</a>
- <a class='link-tutorial' href='#'>Khan Academy: Introduction to SQL</a>
- <a class='link-tutorial' href='#'>Codecademy: JavaScript</a>

If you're already familiar with Retool, you might want to see the quickstart guide instead.

## What you'll learn
After completing this tutorial, you'll gain the necessary knowledge to:

- Connect your data sources as resources.
- Assemble user interfaces using drag-and-drop components.
- Query resources to interact with data.
- Connect queries and components to manipulate data.
- Extend your app's functionality with JavaScript queries and transformers.
- These terms and concepts may not be familiar but you'll learn about them as you work through the tutorial. As you complete each lesson, you can track your progress and test your knowledge using the widget at the bottom of the page.

## What you'll build
You will build a web app that allows you to perform common user management actions. These actions include editing user information, like name and email addresses, and blocking and unblocking users.
